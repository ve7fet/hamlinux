1. Introduction
======================
Voyage Linux is Debian derived distribution that is best run on a x86 embedded 
platforms such as PC Engines ALIX/WRAP, Soekris 45xx/48xx and Atom-based boards.

It can also run on low-end x86 PC platforms. Typical installation requires 
128MB disk space, although larger storage allows more packages to be installed.
Voyage Linux is so small that it is best suitable for running a full-feature 
firewall, wireless access point, Asterisk/VoIP gateway, music player or network 
storage device. 

Currently, Voyage Linux has the following editions:

    * Voyage Linux - the basic version
    * Voyage ONE - VoIP, mesh software, networking tools, etc.
    * Voyage MPD - Music Player Daemon

All editions are delivered as distribution tarball and Live CD in i386 
architecture. AMD64 architecture is available for Voyage Linux only. We also 
offer SDK to ease customizing Voyage Linux. 

For more information about Voyage Linux, please visit:
	http://linux.voyage.hk

2. Installation
======================
Download the Voyage Linux software package from 
	http://www.voyage.hk/download/voyage/ 
to a Linux machine.

extract the software tarball:
	tar --numeric-owner -jxf voyage-<version>.tar.bz2
	
as root, run the installation script:
	cd voyage-<version>
	./usr/local/sbin/voyage.update
	
Before you run the installer you may have to format the disk device.  Assuming 
Compact Flash device on /dev/sda.
	fdisk /dev/sda
	mkfs.ext2 /dev/sda1
	tune2fs -c 0 /dev/sda1

There is a helper script in ./usr/local/sbin/format-cf.sh to ease formatting
and creation of ext2 file system.  Use it at your own risk!
	./usr/local/sbin/format-cf.sh /dev/sda
	
Voyage Linux now requires at least 128MB storage to run.  However, more disk 
space is recommended if you want to add more software and be able to run 
"apt-get upgrade".

voyage.update scripts will ask you a couple of questions to complete the 
installation:

	1 - Create new Voyage Linux disk
	2 - Update existing Voyage configuration
	3 - Exit

Press 1 to install voyage to disk device.  After all, you will be prompted to 
the main installation menu.  You should go through the menu item 1 - 6 in 
sequence.

	1 - Specify Distribution Directory
	2 - Select Target Profile
	3 - Select Target Disk
	4 - Select Target Bootstrap Loader
	5 - Configure Target Console
	6 - Copy Distribution to Target
	7 - Exit
  
It will take a short whlie (~1 min) to copy all files from software package to 
disk device.  The above configuration will be saved to .voyage.config.  If you 
run voyage.update next time, it will use same configuration as default.

Once Voyage Linux is booted up, you will be prompted for login.  The default
root password is "voyage", please change the root password after first login.

	# remountrw
	# passwd

3. Configuration
======================

3.1 Network Interface
======================
edit /etc/network/interface and uncomment the interface configuration section:

# for hostap driver
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
        address 10.1.10.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        broadcast 10.1.10.255
        up iwconfig wlan0 essid voyage mode Master
        up nat.sh wlan0 eth0 "10.1.10.0/24"
        
To enable wlan0 device (for Prism 2.5/hostap driver)

# for atheros madwifi-ng driver
auto ath0
iface ath0 inet static
        address 10.1.20.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        broadcast 10.1.20.255
        madwifi-base wifi0
        wireless-mode Master
        up iwpriv ath0 mode 3
        up iwconfig ath0 mode master
        up iwconfig ath0 essid voyage
        up iwconfig ath0 txpower auto
        up iwconfig ath0 enc off
        up iwconfig ath0 rate auto
        up nat.sh ath0 eth0 "10.1.20.0/24"

To enable ath0 device (for Atheros/madwifi-ng driver)

A friendly script, nat.sh, is located in /usr/local/sbin/, generates all 
necessary iptables rules for NAT'ing interface. nat.sh is now integrated to 
work with nocat.  Syntax:
	nat.sh <nat device> <output device> <network address>
	
	<nat device> - a tag to identify the NAT interface, no need to be a real 
		device name, but should be unqiue if multiple NAT devices are 
		configured
	<output device> - the outbound device name for NAT
	<network address> - the IP network with mask for NAT

3.2 DHCP/DNS - dnsmasq
======================
DHCP support from dnsmasq is now enabled by default. 

Edit /etc/dnsmasq.more.conf and there are following lines:

dhcp-leasefile=/var/tmp/dnsmasq.leases
dhcp-range=wlan0,10.1.10.10,10.1.10.250,24h
dhcp-range=eth1,10.1.20.10,10.1.20.250,24h
dhcp-range=eth2,10.1.30.10,10.1.30.250,24h
dhcp-range=eth3,10.1.40.10,10.1.40.250,24h

dnsmasq will provide IP address lease 10.1.10.10-250, 10.1.20.10-250, 
10.1.30.10-250, 10.1.40.10-250.

Comment out all the lines in /etc/dnsmasq.more.conf to disable DHCP in dnsmasq.

3.3 Hostap
======================
Kernel source was patched to include the current driver version 0.4.7 for 
2.6.8 and 2.6.12 voyage kernels.  Starting from 2.6.14, it is included in 
stock kernel.  The hostap driver in all voyage kernels has 
PRISM2_NON_VOLATILE_DOWNLOAD enabled to allow non-volatile flashing of 
firmware.  

(http://hostap.epitest.fi/)

3.4 Prism54
======================
Prism54 driver is included in voyage kernel.  Voyage Linux already bundled 
the required firmware in /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware/isl3890.

(http://www.prism54.org)

3.5 Madwifi
======================
Voyage distro is now using madwifi-ng driver as default.  
To configure atheros device, the full interface definition should look like:

    auto ath0
	iface ath0 inet static
	        address 10.1.20.1
	        netmask 255.255.255.0
	        broadcast 10.1.20.255
	        madwifi-base wifi1
	        wireless-mode Master
	        up iwpriv ath0 mode 3
	        up iwconfig ath0 mode master
	        up iwconfig ath0 essid voyage
	        up iwconfig ath0 txpower auto
	        up iwconfig ath0 enc off
	        up iwconfig ath0 rate auto
	        up nat.sh ath0 eth0 "10.1.20.0/24"
	
Please note tht voyage kernel does not comes with madwifi driver anymore.  
Instead, they are available in separate module package.  

madwifi-ng has the default auto create option which will create the VAP device 
in STA mode.  To disable autocreate option, in /etc/modules you can add:

   ath_pci autocreate=none
   
or add a new files /etc/modprobe.d/madwifi with the followng line:

   options ath_pci autocreate=none

(http://www.madwifi.org)

3.5 Bridging 
====================== 
The most common way to WDS bridge wireless (ath0 & ath1), LAN (eth0) as follow:

	auto br0
	iface br0 inet static
	       address 192.168.1.2
	       netmask 255.255.255.0
	       network 192.168.1.0
	       broadcast 192.168.1.255
	       gateway 192.168.1.1
	       bridge_ports eth0 ath0 ath1
	       pre-up wlanconfig ath0 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode ap
	       pre-up wlanconfig ath1 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode wds
	       pre-up iwpriv ath0 mode 11g
	       pre-up iwconfig ath0 essid "voyage-wds" channel 1
	       up ifconfig ath0 down ; ifconfig ath0 up # this is a workaround
	       up iwpriv ath1 wds 1
	       up iwpriv ath1 wds_add AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
	       up ifconfig ath1 down ; ifconfig ath1 up # this is a workaround
	       post-down wlanconfig ath0 destroy
	       post-down wlanconfig ath1 destroy
	       
Removing the ath1 (WDS VAP) line, a simple wireless bridge is setup instead.

There are some samples in /etc/network/interface to ease the setup of bridge.

3.8 Hostapd
======================
To enable hostapd, edit /etc/default/hostapd and add the following line:

RUN_DAEMON="yes"

A sample /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf is like below:

#bridge=br0   #uncomment this line if bridged.
interface=ath0
driver=madwifi
logger_syslog=-1
logger_syslog_level=2
logger_stdout=-1
logger_stdout_level=2
debug=4
dump_file=/tmp/hostapd.dump
ctrl_interface=/var/run/hostapd
ctrl_interface_group=0
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=3
eapol_key_index_workaround=0
eap_server=0
wpa=3
ssid=voyage-wds
wpa_passphrase=voyage-wds
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
eapol_version=1
 

3.9 wpa-supplicant
======================

If you want to connect to a WPA-PSK enabled AP, first generate the 
/etc/wpa_suppliant.conf.  For example, if the essid and pre-shared key are 
both "voyage-wds", execute the following commands:

# wpa_passphrase voyage-wds voyage-wds>> /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

Then, edit /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf and adding key_mgmt and 
proto parameters:

network={
    ssid="voyage-wds"
    #psk="voyage-wds"
    psk=76ab47787aa8b560895f617dd351ad9d32faa86232f5366b6554832073d07481
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    proto=WPA
#   proto=RSN	# uncomment for WPA2
}

Edit /etc/network/interfaces and add the following entries:

auto ath0
iface ath0 inet dhcp
        madwifi-base wifi0
        wireless-mode Managed
        wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

This will create ath0 for wifi0 devices, using the specified wpa_supplicant.conf

3.10 LED Support
======================
Voyage kernel >= 2.6.23 (as in Voyage 0.5) comes with LED driver for WRAP, ALIX 
and Soekris 48xx boards.

To enable LED control, simply load the corresponding kernel module
	# modprobe leds-alix (for ALIX)
	# modprobe leds-wrap (for WRAP)
	# modprobe leds-net48xx (for Soekris 48xx)

LED could then be controlled in /sys/class/leds/<device>:#. For example,

To turn on LED on ALIX:
	# echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:1/brightness
	# echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:2/brightness
	# echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/brightness

To turn off LED:
	# echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:1/brightness
	# echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:2/brightness
	# echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/brightness

There are more interesting feature for LED control, first load the following 
LED trigger modules:
	# modprobe ledtrig-heartbeat
	# modprobe ledtrig-timer

1. enable LED1 for heartbeat trigger - higher the load, faster it blinks
	# echo heartbeat > /sys/class/leds/alix\:1/trigger

2. enable LED2 to show ide disk activity
	# echo ide-disk > /sys/class/leds/alix\:2/trigger

3. enable LED3 for net device, on eth0 for link, send and receive
	echo netdev > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/trigger
	echo eth0 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/device_name
   	echo "link tx rx" > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/mode

4. enable LED3 for timer-based control, 1 sec on, 5 sec off
	# echo timer > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/trigger
	# echo 1000 >  /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/delay_on
	# echo 5000 >  /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/delay_off

to turn off trigger
	# echo none > /sys/class/leds/alix\:1/trigger
	# echo none > /sys/class/leds/alix\:2/trigger
	# echo none > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/trigger 
	
In 0.5.1, if ALIX and WRAP install profile is selected, heartbeat and ide-disk 
driver will be automatically enabled at boot. To disable this feature, edit
/etc/default/voyage-util and update VOYAGE_LED variable to "NO":
	VOYAGE_LEDS="NO"
	
3.10 Ath9k support
======================
Ath9k uses nl80211 driver for hostap functions. So, in 
/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf, append the following at the end of the file.

driver=nl80211
interface=wlan0
logger_syslog=-1
logger_syslog_level=2
logger_stdout=-1
logger_stdout_level=2
debug=4
dump_file=/tmp/hostapd.dump
ctrl_interface=/var/run/hostapd
ctrl_interface_group=0
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=3
eapol_key_index_workaround=0
eap_server=0
wpa=3
ssid=voyage-wpa
wpa_passphrase=voyage-wpa
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
channel=11
hw_mode=g
eapol_version=1

Please note that Voyage Linux use wlan0 for ath9k interface. From the above 
configure, WPA/WPA2 is configured, using voyage-wpa as both SSID and 
pre-shared key, running 802.11g mode on channel 11. eapol_version=1 is set for 
backward compatibility to my damn old 2001 iBook. 

At last, don't forget to enable wlan0 in /etc/network/interfaces:

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
        address 10.1.10.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        broadcast 10.1.10.255
        up nat.sh wlan0 eth0 "10.1.10.0/24"

You don't need to set anything with iw tools since hostapd will do it for you. 
Now, make sure hostapd is enabled in /etc/default/hostapd and restart wlan0 
interface and hostapd by:

# ifdown wlan0
# ifup wlan0
# /etc/init.d/hostapd restart

3.11 voyage-sync script
=======================

Starting from 0.6, the legacy /ro and /rw directories will be replaced by
voyage-sync script, which is located under /etc/init.d/.  At boot, /var/tmp
and /var/log are by default mounted under tmpfs.  All the changes will be 
synchronized back to disk at shutdown. To sync back to disk manually while 
running, run:

# remountrw
# /etc/init.d/voyage-sync sync
# remountro

If you want to add more directories to tmpfs, modify VOYAGE_SYNC_DIRS in 
/etc/default/voyage-util.  

For more information on the usage, please read /etc/default/voyage-util.

4. Board-specific Notes
=======================

4.1 WRAP support
======================

4.1.1 Watchdog for WRAP
=======================
For WRAP board, wd1100 has been ported to kernel 2.6.  If you choose WRAP
option in voyage.update, wd1100 driver will be added to /etc/module.  

To load wd1100 to kernel, run the following commands:

	modprobe wd1100
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/dev/wd/graceful
	echo 30 > /proc/sys/dev/wd/timeout
or
	modprobe wd1100 sysctl_wd_graceful=0 sysctl_wd_timeout=30

This will set timeout value to 30 seconds.  

You will have to restart watchdog userland program to activate watchdog timer
	/etc/init.d/watchdog restart

In addition, you will need to make sure that /etc/watchdog.conf is properly 
configured.  For above watchdog module configuration for WRAP, the following 
settings should do:

watchdog-device = /dev/watchdog
interval	    = 15

And make sure the watchdog device is available:
	
	mknod -m 600 /dev/watchdog c 10 130

You may also add the following line to /etc/modules to enable loading wd1100 
driver at startup: 
	
	wd1100 sysctl_wd_graceful=0 sysctl_wd_timeout=30

To test watchdog module, you can try to stop the watchdog userland program.
	/etc/init.d/watchdog stop
The hardware will restart after 30 seconds at most.

4.1.2 Temperature sensors for WRAP
==================================
If you choose WRAP in voyage.update, the required modules would be added
to /etc/modules.  It adds the following modules in /etc/modules:
	scx200_acb base=0x810,0x820
	lm77

You will find a new driver in /sys/bus/i2c/drivers/lm77/.  To read the 
temperature, 
	cat /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-1/1-0048/temp1_input

Divide the temps by 1000 you will get the temperature reading in Celcius.  
Unfortunately, the temperature reading can not be retrieved using "sensors" util.

Please note that latest WRAP2D/E does not host lm77 sensor anymore.
------------------------------------------
If you are using commodity hardware other than WRAP, the easiest way would be 
installing lm-sensors package by
	
	apt-get install lm-sensors
	
and then run sensors-detect

4.2 ALIX support
======================

4.2.1 Temperature sensors for ALIX.1 and ALIX2/3
================================================
When running Voyage Linux with ALIX, choose ALIX profile in voyage update,
the required modules would be added to /etc/modules.  It adds the following 
modules in /etc/modules:
	w83627hf 
	lm90
	geodewdt
	
ALIX.1 board uses w83627hf driver while ALIX.2/3 uses lm90.  You can get the 
temperature reading from sensors program, or get the values from sysfs:

(for ALIX.1)
	cat /sys/devices/platform/w83627hf.656/temp1_input
	cat /sys/devices/platform/w83627hf.656/temp2_input
	cat /sys/devices/platform/w83627hf.656/temp3_input


You may also use sensors utility to get the temperature reading.  If temp1 
reading may not be ready at boot up, you need to modify w83627hf section in 
/etc/sensors.conf:

chip "w83782d-*" "w83627hf-*"
...
	set sensor1 1
	
Known Issue: the readings returned from w83627hf is not very accurate.  temp1 
reading is too low (~30C) and some offset should be applied.  But temp1 reading 
can move down to 20C if you apply cooling agent on the Geode processor.  temp2 
and temp3 do not move up or down too much at idle or under high low.

(for ALIX.2/3)
	cat /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-004c/temp1_input
	cat /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-004c/temp2_input

4.2.2 Geode Watchdog driver for ALIX
====================================
Voyage Linux comes with geodewdt driver that uses the multi-function general 
purpose timer in CS5536 for watchdog timer.  To use geodewdt driver, load 
geodewdt driver or add geodewdt to /etc/modules.  Restart watchdog daemon to 
make it effective.

There was a known issue in Voyage 0.4.1 with ALIX.2/3b boards.  It has been 
identified that Voyage 0.4.1 cannot be booted successfully on ALIX.2/3b board 
with some BIOS versions.  Voyage 0.4.1 kernel has in-kernel, geode-specific 
codes that enables the multi-purpose general function timer (mfgpt), which is 
required for the watchdog driver. The kernel code works properly on Alix.1c 
board. However, the same piece of code may not work on Alix.2/3 and will 
encounter boot hang.

There are three workarounds.
1. Use Voyage 0.4.0 instead of 0.4.1
2. Uses 0.94 or later TinyBIOS with "MFGPT workaround" set to ON
3. Use ALIX.1c instead of ALIX.2/3b board for running Voyage Linux 0.4.1. 

Voyage 0.5 with kernel 2.6.23 comes with a new implementation of mfgpt code 
that no longer requires "MFGPT workaround".  Hence, "MFGPT workaround" 
in TinyBIOS must set to OFF.  Otherwise, same bootup hang will be encountered.  
Care must be taken to turn off "MFGPT workaround" if you upgrade from 0.4.1 to 
0.5.

5. General Issues
======================

  What are the serial port console settings:
	- In 0.3, voyage.update provides options for serial port settings
	- In 0.2 or before, the serial port console must be set at ==> 9600 N 8 1

  Where are the files stored that need to be read-write:
	- Initially they are stored on /ro, at boot time they are copied over to 
	  a dynamic ram drive (limited to 8 Mb) at /rw.
	  Files are then symlinked to the /rw.

  How can I add a program:
	- use "apt-get install <program>" of course

  How can I add a file or install a program from sources (without using apt-get)
  so it comes up every time I boot:
	- /usr/local/sbin/remountrw to allow Read-Write
	- Move the file or the program to it's location in /ro
	- Symlink the file's original location to /rw
	- fastreboot

	EXAMPLE:
	You install "webmin" from sources, the miniserver is in /var/webmin 
	directory, configuration files are in /etc/webmin directory and the start on
	is in /etc/init.d/webmin :

	- move /var/webmin directory to /ro/var/webmin
	- symlink in the original /var to /rw//var/webmin
	- create a symlink in /etc/rcS.d/ to start automagically as last one at boot time

	#remountrw
	#mv /var/webmin /ro/var/webmin
	#ln -s /rw//var/webmin /var/webmin
	#ln -s /etc/init.d/webmin /etc/rcS.d/S56webmin
	#fastreboot

6.3 Known Issues
======================
- when running madwifi driver with AP mode, stuck beacon problem may occur:
    wifi0: ath_bstuck_tasklet: Stuck beacon; resetting (beacon miss )
  When this error happens, sometime it is not recoverable.  After some test,
  it is found that the most stable vesion is 0.9.4-rc2, fallback by:
 # wget http://www.voyage.hk/dists/experimental/madwifi/madwifi-modules-2.6.32-voyage_0.9.4~rc2-1+8.0-1_i386.deb
 # apt-get install madwifi-modules-2.6.32-voyage_0.9.4~rc2-1+8.0-1_i386.deb
  
- When using CF card for heavy write operation, the following settings on 
  pdflush should be applied (Recommended by PCEngines). 
    # echo 500 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs
    # echo 1024000 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_bytes
    # echo 100 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs 
  You can also put these files to /etc/sysctl.conf
    vm.dirty_expire_centisecs=500
    vm.dirty_bytes=1024000
    vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs=100 

- When installing from Voyage Linux amd64 Live CD to disk, grub installation may
  not work properly.  Please use lilo as bootloader instead.

- Older generation of VIA C3 processor may not be booted properly.

- Timezone files are removed to save space.  To restore it, run:
    apt-get install --reinstall tzdata

- If Voyage cannot boot complaining rootfs can't be located, tty to added the 
following to the kernel boot parameters:
	"ide=nodma all_generic_ide"
or try (on or after 0.6.5):
	"ide_core.nodma=0.0"

- Sometimes, grub boot screen may not appear after BIOS post if the boot
partition is too large (~4GB).  Creating a smaller boot partition (512MB) and 
install Voyage to it may solve this issue.

- There have been repeatedly reported problem for lilo installation problem
while voyage.update is installing lilo bootloader to the flash media.  This
problem should have be fixed in Voyage 0.5.  If you encounter a similar 
problem again, please report to voyage-linux mailing list.

- In case you encountered locale and dialog complain when installing package
via "apt-get install", you can carry out the following commands to get rid
of the error message:
	apt-get install dialog apt-utils

- There is a problem reported when installing voyage over usb device using ub 
kernel module.  Moreover, it is assumed that voyage is installed in /dev/hda1
of the target platform.  

6.4 Live CD and PXE boot
======================
Voyage Live CD is now available for every stable voyage release:
	http://www.voyage.hk/download/ISO/
	
Daily build Live CD is also available at:
	http://www.voyage.hk/download/ISO/voyage-current.iso

You can run the Live CD under VMWare for testing purpose.  In addition, it
can act as a installation CD and PXE boot server as well.

You can find README.live-cd and README.pxe from the root direcory of Live CD.
	
6.5 TODOs
======================
1. light-weighted web server (thttpd + php) for system configuration
2. further reducing in size
3. scripts for setting up network configuration

7.0 Deprecated Documentation
======================
This section documents deprecated documentation which is no longer supported.

7.1 NoCatSplash 
======================
NoCatSplash is included in Voyage Linux, but it is disabled by default.  Edit 
/etc/default/nocatsplash and set ENABLE="true" to enable it.  You will can start 
or stop NoCatSplash by 
	/etc/init.d/nocatsplash [start|stop]
	
Next, you will also need to edit /etc/nocat.conf to setup NoCatSplash properly.  
The most common way is to add the following lines at the end of /etc/nocat.conf:
ExternalDevice  eth0  
InternalDevice  wlan0
LocalNetwork    10.1.10.0/24

Make sure that wlan0 matches the LocalNetwork IP address, you should double-
check that from ifconfig.

7.2 NoCatAuth
======================
NoCatAuth is not included in Voyage Linux.  However, it can be installed by 
running:
	apt-get install nocatauth-gateway
	
Same as NoCatSplash, set ENABLE="true" in /etc/default/nocatauth-gateway to 
enable it in boot up.   Note that nocat.conf is located in 
/etc/nocatauth/gateway and the most common to configure nocatauth-gateway is 
appending the following to nocat.conf:

ExternalDevice  eth0  
InternalDevice  wlan0
LocalNetwork    10.1.10.0/24

You may also want to touch GatewayMode (default=Passive):
GatewayMode [Passive|Captive|Open]

It is better to un-install NoCatSplash by "apt-get remove nocatsplash" and 
"rm /etc/nocat.conf" explicitly to avoid confusion.

As nocatauth requires perl to run, you are required to have a larger disk space 
to run (probably 128MB).  Please also make sure that you can only run either 
NoCatSplash or NoCatAuth, not both.

7.3 Development (0.5 or before)
======================
Voyage Linux is completely buildable through customization framework. You can 
access the CVS Web Repository at: 
	http://cvs.voyage.hk/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/
	
Currently, only voyage-custom project is under development.

There is no plan to provide public access for the CVS repository.  Only 
Web access is available in this moment. However, to encourage development 
nightly tarball is accessible to everyone at:
	http://www.voyage.hk/download/nightly/
	
If you have made chanages to Voyage Linux and the supporting scripts, you 
are encouraged to send all patches to voyage-linux@list.voyage.hk

Voyage includes customization script to allow customizing voyage distro. 
It allows system integrator or interest parties to customize voyage linux 
to roll out their own version based on voyage.

*** customization script only works for Voyage 0.3-0.5 versions.  Support for
0.6 is not yet verified and tested.

voyage-custom.sh syntax:

	voyage-custom.sh <voyage distro dir> <customize profile dir>

For example,

	voyage-custom.sh <voyage_path> <somewhere>/myproj

This will generate the customization distro called voyage-myproj in the 
current directory .

To build the sample "voyage-mesh" distro using customization script:

	<voyage path>/usr/share/voyage-custom/voyage-custom.sh \
		<voyage_path> \
		<voyage_path>/usr/share/voyage-custom/src/mesh

Please note that the script is very experimental and is not tested heavily.  
It is also assumed that you run the script under Debian.  So, it may not work 
under other Linux distribution.  Use it at your own risk!

For more on how to make a customization disto, please read:
	<voyage path>/usr/share/voyage-custom/src/README
or
	http://wiki.voyage.hk/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=customization
	
The customization scripts can also be found in CVS and nightly tarball as well.
