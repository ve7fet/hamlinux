	Amateur Radio Edition
 < http://hamlinux.googlecode.com >   Version: 0.1

1. Introduction
======================
Voyage Linux is Debian derived distribution that is best run on a x86 embedded 
platforms such as PC Engines ALIX/WRAP, Soekris 45xx/48xx and Atom-based boards.

It can also run on low-end x86 PC platforms. Typical installation requires 
128MB disk space, although larger storage allows more packages to be installed.
Voyage Linux is so small that it is best suitable for running a full-feature 
firewall, wireless access point, Asterisk/VoIP gateway, music player or network 
storage device. 

Currently, Voyage Linux has the following editions:

    * Voyage Linux - the basic version
    * Voyage ONE - VoIP, mesh software, networking tools, etc.
    * Voyage MPD - Music Player Daemon
    * Hamlinux - a custom distribution of Voyage Linux targeted at Amateur Radio operators

All editions are delivered as distribution tarball and Live CD in i386 
architecture. AMD64 architecture is available for Voyage Linux only. We also 
offer SDK to ease customizing Voyage Linux.

2. Installation
======================
Download the Voyage Linux software package from 
	http://www.voyage.hk/download/voyage/ 
to a Linux machine.

extract the software tarball:
	tar --numeric-owner -jxf voyage-<version>.tar.bz2
	
as root, run the installation script:
	cd voyage-<version>
	./usr/local/sbin/voyage.update
	
Before you run the installer you may have to format the disk device.  Assuming 
Compact Flash device on /dev/sda.
	fdisk /dev/sda
	mkfs.ext2 /dev/sda1
	tune2fs -c 0 /dev/sda1

There is a helper script in ./usr/local/sbin/format-cf.sh to ease formatting
and creation of ext2 file system.  Use it at your own risk!
	./usr/local/sbin/format-cf.sh /dev/sda
	
Voyage Linux now requires at least 128MB storage to run.  However, more disk 
space is recommended if you want to add more software and be able to run 
"apt-get upgrade".

voyage.update scripts will ask you a couple of questions to complete the 
installation:

	1 - Create new Voyage Linux disk
	2 - Update existing Voyage configuration
	3 - Exit

Press 1 to install voyage to disk device.  After all, you will be prompted to 
the main installation menu.  You should go through the menu item 1 - 6 in 
sequence.

	1 - Specify Distribution Directory
	2 - Select Target Profile
	3 - Select Target Disk
	4 - Select Target Bootstrap Loader
	5 - Configure Target Console
	6 - Copy Distribution to Target
	7 - Exit
  
It will take a short whlie (~1 min) to copy all files from software package to 
disk device.  The above configuration will be saved to .voyage.config.  If you 
run voyage.update next time, it will use same configuration as default.

Once Voyage Linux is booted up, you will be prompted for login.  The default
root password is "voyage", please change the root password after first login.

	# remountrw
	# passwd

3. Configuration
======================

3.1 Network Interface
======================
edit /etc/network/interface and uncomment the interface configuration section:

3.2 LED Support
======================
Voyage kernel >= 2.6.23 (as in Voyage 0.5) comes with LED driver for WRAP, ALIX 
and Soekris 48xx boards.

To enable LED control, simply load the corresponding kernel module
	# modprobe leds-alix (for ALIX)
	# modprobe leds-wrap (for WRAP)
	# modprobe leds-net48xx (for Soekris 48xx)

LED could then be controlled in /sys/class/leds/<device>:#. For example,

To turn on LED on ALIX:
	# echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:1/brightness
	# echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:2/brightness
	# echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/brightness

To turn off LED:
	# echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:1/brightness
	# echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:2/brightness
	# echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/brightness

There are more interesting feature for LED control, first load the following 
LED trigger modules:
	# modprobe ledtrig-heartbeat
	# modprobe ledtrig-timer

1. enable LED1 for heartbeat trigger - higher the load, faster it blinks
	# echo heartbeat > /sys/class/leds/alix\:1/trigger

2. enable LED2 to show ide disk activity
	# echo ide-disk > /sys/class/leds/alix\:2/trigger

3. enable LED3 for net device, on eth0 for link, send and receive
	echo netdev > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/trigger
	echo eth0 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/device_name
   	echo "link tx rx" > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/mode

4. enable LED3 for timer-based control, 1 sec on, 5 sec off
	# echo timer > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/trigger
	# echo 1000 >  /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/delay_on
	# echo 5000 >  /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/delay_off

to turn off trigger
	# echo none > /sys/class/leds/alix\:1/trigger
	# echo none > /sys/class/leds/alix\:2/trigger
	# echo none > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/trigger 
	
In 0.5.1, if ALIX and WRAP install profile is selected, heartbeat and ide-disk 
driver will be automatically enabled at boot. To disable this feature, edit
/etc/default/voyage-util and update VOYAGE_LED variable to "NO":
	VOYAGE_LEDS="NO"
	
3.3 voyage-sync script
=======================

Starting from 0.6, the legacy /ro and /rw directories will be replaced by
voyage-sync script, which is located under /etc/init.d/.  At boot, /var/tmp
and /var/log are by default mounted under tmpfs.  All the changes will be 
synchronized back to disk at shutdown. To sync back to disk manually while 
running, run:

# remountrw
# /etc/init.d/voyage-sync sync
# remountro

If you want to add more directories to tmpfs, modify VOYAGE_SYNC_DIRS in 
/etc/default/voyage-util.  

For more information on the usage, please read /etc/default/voyage-util.

4. Board-specific Notes
=======================

4.1 WRAP support
======================

4.1.1 Watchdog for WRAP
=======================
For WRAP board, wd1100 has been ported to kernel 2.6.  If you choose WRAP
option in voyage.update, wd1100 driver will be added to /etc/module.  

To load wd1100 to kernel, run the following commands:

	modprobe wd1100
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/dev/wd/graceful
	echo 30 > /proc/sys/dev/wd/timeout
or
	modprobe wd1100 sysctl_wd_graceful=0 sysctl_wd_timeout=30

This will set timeout value to 30 seconds.  

You will have to restart watchdog userland program to activate watchdog timer
	/etc/init.d/watchdog restart

In addition, you will need to make sure that /etc/watchdog.conf is properly 
configured.  For above watchdog module configuration for WRAP, the following 
settings should do:

watchdog-device = /dev/watchdog
interval	    = 15

And make sure the watchdog device is available:
	
	mknod -m 600 /dev/watchdog c 10 130

You may also add the following line to /etc/modules to enable loading wd1100 
driver at startup: 
	
	wd1100 sysctl_wd_graceful=0 sysctl_wd_timeout=30

To test watchdog module, you can try to stop the watchdog userland program.
	/etc/init.d/watchdog stop
The hardware will restart after 30 seconds at most.

4.1.2 Temperature sensors for WRAP
==================================
If you choose WRAP in voyage.update, the required modules would be added
to /etc/modules.  It adds the following modules in /etc/modules:
	scx200_acb base=0x810,0x820
	lm77

You will find a new driver in /sys/bus/i2c/drivers/lm77/.  To read the 
temperature, 
	cat /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-1/1-0048/temp1_input

Divide the temps by 1000 you will get the temperature reading in Celcius.  
Unfortunately, the temperature reading can not be retrieved using "sensors" util.

Please note that latest WRAP2D/E does not host lm77 sensor anymore.
------------------------------------------
If you are using commodity hardware other than WRAP, the easiest way would be 
installing lm-sensors package by
	
	apt-get install lm-sensors
	
and then run sensors-detect

4.2 ALIX support
======================

4.2.1 Temperature sensors for ALIX.1 and ALIX2/3
================================================
When running Voyage Linux with ALIX, choose ALIX profile in voyage update,
the required modules would be added to /etc/modules.  It adds the following 
modules in /etc/modules:
	w83627hf 
	lm90
	geodewdt
	
ALIX.1 board uses w83627hf driver while ALIX.2/3 uses lm90.  You can get the 
temperature reading from sensors program, or get the values from sysfs:

(for ALIX.1)
	cat /sys/devices/platform/w83627hf.656/temp1_input
	cat /sys/devices/platform/w83627hf.656/temp2_input
	cat /sys/devices/platform/w83627hf.656/temp3_input


You may also use sensors utility to get the temperature reading.  If temp1 
reading may not be ready at boot up, you need to modify w83627hf section in 
/etc/sensors.conf:

chip "w83782d-*" "w83627hf-*"
...
	set sensor1 1
	
Known Issue: the readings returned from w83627hf is not very accurate.  temp1 
reading is too low (~30C) and some offset should be applied.  But temp1 reading 
can move down to 20C if you apply cooling agent on the Geode processor.  temp2 
and temp3 do not move up or down too much at idle or under high low.

(for ALIX.2/3)
	cat /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-004c/temp1_input
	cat /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-004c/temp2_input

4.2.2 Geode Watchdog driver for ALIX
====================================
Voyage Linux comes with geodewdt driver that uses the multi-function general 
purpose timer in CS5536 for watchdog timer.  To use geodewdt driver, load 
geodewdt driver or add geodewdt to /etc/modules.  Restart watchdog daemon to 
make it effective.

There was a known issue in Voyage 0.4.1 with ALIX.2/3b boards.  It has been 
identified that Voyage 0.4.1 cannot be booted successfully on ALIX.2/3b board 
with some BIOS versions.  Voyage 0.4.1 kernel has in-kernel, geode-specific 
codes that enables the multi-purpose general function timer (mfgpt), which is 
required for the watchdog driver. The kernel code works properly on Alix.1c 
board. However, the same piece of code may not work on Alix.2/3 and will 
encounter boot hang.

There are three workarounds.
1. Use Voyage 0.4.0 instead of 0.4.1
2. Uses 0.94 or later TinyBIOS with "MFGPT workaround" set to ON
3. Use ALIX.1c instead of ALIX.2/3b board for running Voyage Linux 0.4.1. 

Voyage 0.5 with kernel 2.6.23 comes with a new implementation of mfgpt code 
that no longer requires "MFGPT workaround".  Hence, "MFGPT workaround" 
in TinyBIOS must set to OFF.  Otherwise, same bootup hang will be encountered.  
Care must be taken to turn off "MFGPT workaround" if you upgrade from 0.4.1 to 
0.5.

5. General Issues
======================

  What are the serial port console settings:
	- In 0.3, voyage.update provides options for serial port settings
	- In 0.2 or before, the serial port console must be set at ==> 9600 N 8 1

  Where are the files stored that need to be read-write:
	- Initially they are stored on /ro, at boot time they are copied over to 
	  a dynamic ram drive (limited to 8 Mb) at /rw.
	  Files are then symlinked to the /rw.

  How can I add a program:
	- use "apt-get install <program>" of course

  How can I add a file or install a program from sources (without using apt-get)
  so it comes up every time I boot:
	- /usr/local/sbin/remountrw to allow Read-Write
	- Move the file or the program to it's location in /ro
	- Symlink the file's original location to /rw
	- fastreboot

	EXAMPLE:
	You install "webmin" from sources, the miniserver is in /var/webmin 
	directory, configuration files are in /etc/webmin directory and the start on
	is in /etc/init.d/webmin :

	- move /var/webmin directory to /ro/var/webmin
	- symlink in the original /var to /rw//var/webmin
	- create a symlink in /etc/rcS.d/ to start automagically as last one at boot time

	#remountrw
	#mv /var/webmin /ro/var/webmin
	#ln -s /rw//var/webmin /var/webmin
	#ln -s /etc/init.d/webmin /etc/rcS.d/S56webmin
	#fastreboot

6.2 Development (0.6 or later)
======================
Starting from 0.6.0, Voyage Linux is built by Debian Live.  You can find
the subversion repository for Debian Live config in:

http://svn.voyage.hk/repos/voyage/trunk/voyage-live

Getting start to build Voyage Linux under Debian r5.0(lenny) or Voyage SDK:
# apt-get install live-helper
# svn co http://svn.voyage.hk/repos/voyage/trunk/voyage-live voyage-live
# cd voyage-live
# ./build.sh iso 	<= this will build the Live CD
# ./build.sh tar 	<= this will build .tar.bz2 distro
# ./build.sh sdk 	<= this will build sdk Live CD

6.3 Known Issues
======================
- When installing from Voyage Linux amd64 Live CD to disk, grub installation may
  not work properly.  Please use lilo as bootloader instead.

- Older generation of VIA C3 processor may not be booted properly.

- Timezone files are removed to save space.  To restore it, run:
    apt-get install --reinstall tzdata

- If Voyage cannot boot complaining rootfs can't be located, tty to added the 
following to the kernel boot parameters:
	"ide=nodma all_generic_ide"
or try (on or after 0.6.5):
	"ide_core.nodma=0.0"

- Sometimes, grub boot screen may not appear after BIOS post if the boot
partition is too large (~4GB).  Creating a smaller boot partition (512MB) and 
install Voyage to it may solve this issue.

- There have been repeatedly reported problem for lilo installation problem
while voyage.update is installing lilo bootloader to the flash media.  This
problem should have be fixed in Voyage 0.5.  If you encounter a similar 
problem again, please report to voyage-linux mailing list.

- In case you encountered locale and dialog complain when installing package
via "apt-get install", you can carry out the following commands to get rid
of the error message:
	apt-get install dialog apt-utils

- There is a problem reported when installing voyage over usb device using ub 
kernel module.  Moreover, it is assumed that voyage is installed in /dev/hda1
of the target platform.  

6.4 Live CD and PXE boot
======================
Voyage Live CD is now available for every stable voyage release:
	http://www.voyage.hk/download/ISO/
	
Daily build Live CD is also available at:
	http://www.voyage.hk/download/ISO/voyage-current.iso

You can run the Live CD under VMWare for testing purpose.  In addition, it
can act as a installation CD and PXE boot server as well.

You can find README.live-cd and README.pxe from the root direcory of Live CD.
